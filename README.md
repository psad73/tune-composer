# tune-composer (tune c, tunec)
Script for updating composer/vendor without shell access at production server.

Ugly written, but working (soon).

## Why?

Because I'm tired of uploading +800MB of files everytime one library is updated. Even with zip it takes too much time.

## Why HG/Merurial?

Because it does not collide with the git system.
